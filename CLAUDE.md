## Project

**Robin**

Robin is an AI-powered second brain that captures thoughts through conversation and structures them into a searchable knowledge base. Users interact with AI (via MCP or web UI), and Robin runs in the background to automatically extract atomic ideas (fragments), classify them into topic clusters (threads), and store everything in personal git-backed markdown repositories.

This repo is a migration from the original `stateful-robin-impl` monorepo. The Go gateway is being removed — its functionality will be stubbed via a facade in the gateway client that returns expected empty/default objects. The server app is the sole application, owning all intelligence, auth, API, MCP, and AI pipeline responsibilities.

**Core Value:** Users can capture raw thoughts and have them automatically structured into searchable, interconnected knowledge — without manual organization.

### Constraints

- **No regressions**: Workspace package boundaries (`@robin/agent`, `@robin/queue`, `@robin/shared`) must be preserved exactly — no flattening
- **Gateway facade**: Gateway client must return structurally valid responses so the server doesn't crash on gateway-dependent code paths
- **Single source**: Migration from existing working code, not a rewrite
- **Workspace layout**: `core/` and `packages/*` are top-level workspace entries, no `apps/` subdirectory

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.

## Developer Profile

> Profile not yet configured. Run `/gsd-profile-user` to generate your developer profile.
> This section is managed by `generate-claude-profile` -- do not edit manually.
